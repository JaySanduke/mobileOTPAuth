Production Deployment Strategy

1. Dockerize everything

Multi-stage Dockerfile (build Go app â†’ small size final image).
docker-compose for local dev (PostgreSQL + Redis + App).

2. Database Setup PostgreSQL + Redis

Deploy as StatefulSets on Kubernetes.
Use Persistent Volumes (SSD storage for Postgres).
Secure configs with Kubernetes Secrets.
And Kubernetes config maps for the environment variables

3. Kubernetes (K8s) Setup

We will use kubenetes as it is benefiacial for less downtimes and high availabilty

Deployment: 3 replicas for auth-service.
StatefulSet: PostgreSQL and Redis.
Ingress: Use NGINX Ingress Controller + TLS + rate limiting.

4. Scaling Strategy

Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory.
Plan Redis clustering and Postgres read replicas when scaling up.

5. Security

HTTPS only via Ingress.
JWTs should properly signed and rotated.
Rate limiting on login, OTP requests.
Fingerprinting for device tracking.
